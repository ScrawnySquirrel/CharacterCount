Loop through English letters
  Get character count for each English letter
  Store in dictionary
Loop through the dictionary of letters
  Sum total character count of letters
  Calculate the relative distribution of letters
  Output to CSV file
Verify that sum of probability of letters equals 1 (100%)
Output the dictionary to CSV file with format: letter,count,probability

Task 2: Get conditional probability
Get both plaintext/ciphertext CSV (with probabilities) and letter to calculate
Find the line in plaintext CSV with letter to calculate
Loop through ciphertext CSV
  Calculate conditional probability P(M=m|C=c)
  Maintain the letter with probability closest to 1
  Output to files
Display result
